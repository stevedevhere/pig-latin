# Pig Latin


Function that takes in a string of lowercase words and returns the string in Pig Latin. If the first letter of a word is a consonant, move it to the end of the word, and add “ay”. If the first letter is a vowel, just return the same string with “way” added to the end.

`Example: “amber pig” -> “amberway igpay”`
